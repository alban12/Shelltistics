# Shelltistics

This is a small shell script that I've made in order to get letters and words appearance statistics in a text file  

## Usage 

1.Get the shell file <br>
2.Set the rights to execute it : chmod +x langstat.sh <br>
3.Run it <br>
```
**./langstat.sh**   [--position|--inverse] FILE
```
